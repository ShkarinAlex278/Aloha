# Aloha Project 

The web page includes three different sizes: (for mobile phones with content area is 414px, tablet version for content area is 600px and desktop version of laptop). All images were provided by RED Academy Toronto. My goal was to create a version of Aloha's Web site that visually matches the layout version.

Personal Learnings:
With this project, I used .html, .css and .js. The plugin was taken from the source - Flickity.

This project was created using Visual Studio Code. To successfully launch the project, it is recommended to have a [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).
