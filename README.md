# Aloha Project 
<<<<<<< HEAD

The web page includes three different sizes: (for mobile phones with content area is 414px X 736px, tablet version for content area is 600px X 1024px and desktop version of laptop). All images were provided by RED Academy Toronto. My goal was to create a version of Aloha's Web site that visually matches the layout version.

Personal Learnings:
With this project, I used .html, .css and .js. The plugin was taken from the source - Flickity.

This project was created using Visual Studio Code. To successfully launch the project, it is recommended to have a [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).
